# MLB Hit Prediction

---
### Description
This project focuses on predicting hit outcomes using new MLB swing data with Python. To enhance model performance and accuracy, I employed several advanced techniques throughout the process.

During model training, I used Optuna alongside 5-fold Cross-Validation for hyperparameter optimization, ensuring the best model configurations. I also expanded the feature set through feature engineering, leveraging my understanding of baseball to extract meaningful insights. Eventually, I employed a soft voting ensemble, combining models trained on different folds to achieve more robust and reliable predictions.
